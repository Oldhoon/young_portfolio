# 🌐 My 3D Developer Portfolio

A personal 3D portfolio website built with **React.js**, **Three.js**, and supporting libraries.  
This project highlights my projects, skills, and background with interactive 3D models, animations, and custom-generated assets.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Custom Design**: Unique logos and hero background images generated with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Lovart.  
- 🛸 **3D Models**: Plane, floating React figure, and computer models sourced from Sketchfab and integrated using React Three Fiber.  
- 🌌 **Animations**: Smooth text and container transitions with React Motion, orbiting circles (About Me) and particles/borderbeam (Contact) via MagicUI, and word-flipping animations from Aceternity.  
- 📦 **Interactive 3D**: Converted `.glb` models into React Three Fiber components using [gltf.pmnd.rs](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/).  
- 💻 **Responsive Layout**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, scalable design across devices.
